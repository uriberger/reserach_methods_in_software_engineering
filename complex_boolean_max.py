""" This function receives three lists: search_list, include_list, exclude_list, and an integer
"num". It returns the maximum negative value in search_list which is included in include_list and
is not divisible by num, or not included in exclude_list and is divisible by num, or minus infinity
if such a number doesn't exist.

Features tested:
- Multiple if statements vs. complex boolean expression
