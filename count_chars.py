""" This function counts how many times each of the count characters appears in the corpus, and
returns the characters that appear more than 'threshold' times.

Features tested:
- List and dictionary comprehension vs. loops
- Use of compound assignment operators vs. use of =

Possible bug creations:
- "if count_dics[count_char] > threshold:" -> "if count_char > threshold:"
